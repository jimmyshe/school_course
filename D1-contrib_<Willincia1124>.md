For this project, my main contribution is mainly the addDataset part and the removeDataSet part, 
including the helper functions that are related to them. In addition to these, 
I worked with my partner together to finish the debugging phase.

This is the commit that fixed the bug in addDataSet(basically handling the cache and disk part of it)

This commit fixed some bugs related to the response and edge cases.

Me and my partner worked together in the debugging phase and we share our ideas of some bugs and basically he did the committment.
I also commit only once after done the main part of addDataSet so that's why I have a few commitments.

During this project, I think we worked well in the connection part of our project since we had made our decisions of how to join the 
data before the project. We designed our datastructe together so we did not encounter huge problems when we were connecting our parts
However, I think I should view more posts on piazza about some details about the project because the cache part really got me stucked
for quite a while.
