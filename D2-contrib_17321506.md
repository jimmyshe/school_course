For this project, my main contribution is mainly the addDataset part and the removeDataSet part, 
including the helper functions that are related to them. In addition to these, 
I worked with my partner together to finish the debugging phase.

[This is the initial version of addDataset for D2, including removeDataSet.](https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team13/commit/6fa45a0254f0f7fe36b5c21e1c5382f2c9fee646)

[Fix the rest of the bugs(only one left) of D2](https://github.com/CS3102017Jan/cpsc310project_team13/commit/f6820d9817bd1b046209b33a651a35332e38a389)

During this project, we started early and make significant progress. However, that detail related to the file name troubled both of us nearly a week
, for the next phase, it is important for us to check this kind of trivial details so we won't waste that much time on it.
